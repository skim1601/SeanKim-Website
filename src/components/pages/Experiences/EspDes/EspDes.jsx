                <p>Project and team based first year course at University of Toronto Engineering.
                    In both semesters, I was selected as the project manager for two teams that consist of 
                    six engineering students. I was responsible for accelerating and
                    improving the team's workflow through using Gantt charts and setting
                    internal deadlines, allowing the team to complete tasks 1 to 3 days advance 
                    before the actual deadline. <br/><br/>

                    First project was mainly on developing an efficient unloading design for a delievery
                    robot. The team's final conceptual design was a hydraulic design. <br/><br/>

                    Second project was on developing a design for an efficient grime removal on the client's window.
                    The team's final design was Titanium Dioxide coating, and this required experiments at the
                    Chemical Engineering lab to test the hydrophilicity and transparency of the glass when the 
                    solution is applied. The team presented the final design to the client and the Engineering Manager
                    in a professional manner. <br/><br/>

                    To conclude, my experience in project management provided me a solid understanding in 
                    working with different people. For instance, having weekly meeting with 
                    the Engineering Manager and monthly meeting with the client.
