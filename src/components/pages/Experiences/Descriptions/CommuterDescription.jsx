            The Commuter Student Directorship is planned to foster a sense of belonging and involvement between 
            all student commuters in University of Toronto Engineering Community 
            by creating opportunities, events, and programs to enrich the commuter community. <br/><br/>
            I developed the organizationâ€™s website with React.js, which is 
            expected to be accessed by over 400 commuter students at the University of Toronto Engineering Community. More details available on the Project page. <br/><br/>
            The website is accessible by the link below.
